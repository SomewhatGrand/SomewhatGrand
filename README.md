What's up nerds, (Joke)
I am SomewhatGrand, and I have absolutely no idea on what I am doing here (Kinda).
I joined here because I want to learn to code.
I have just but a few questions for you guys.
First off, can I code in github? 
Second, can I run code in github?
Well that's really all for me.
Bye guys!
